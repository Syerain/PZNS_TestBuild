# PZNS_TestBuild

This is originally a sample/example project that requires the PZNS Framework.
- https://github.com/shadowhunter100/PZNS

I forked it to learn how to use the PZNS Framework, like making a NPC grp

## The Example should cover the following:
- Creating an NPC Group or Faction  
- Creating an NPC and assigning it to the group.  
- Setting an NPC's skills.  
- Spawning an NPC via in-game events.  
- (Above are the original notes)
